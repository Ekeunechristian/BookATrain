# Train Booking Website

## Overview
This is a fictive train booking platform designed to showcase my web development skills. The project features a fully functional web application that allows different types of users—administrators, registered members, and guest users—to interact with the system.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: PHP (without libraries)  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **Local Server**: XAMPP  

## Features
### User Roles
- **Admin Operations**:  
  - Admin authentication for secure access.  
  - Ability to add, delete, and modify train schedules.  
  - Manage train information and availability.  

- **Registered Users**:  
  - Member user authentication for secure logins.  
  - Eligible for discounts with a railcard.  
  - Book tickets by selecting destinations and travel dates.  
  - Receive confirmation tickets via email.  

- **Guest Users**:  
  - Search for available train routes and schedules.  
  - View basic information without needing to register.  

### Booking Process
1. **Select Destination**: Users can enter their desired travel destination and date.  
2. **Choose Available Trains**: View available options based on the selected criteria.  
3. **Ticket Confirmation**: Upon booking, users receive a confirmation ticket via email.  
4. **Dummy Payment Gateway**: Integrated payment process to simulate real transactions.  

## User Interface & Experience
The UI/UX has been carefully designed to ensure an intuitive and seamless experience for all users. The interface is user-friendly, making navigation easy and efficient.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git 
2. **Set up a local server using XAMPP.**  
3. **Import the SQL database if applicable.**  
4. **Navigate to the project directory in your web browser.**  

## Future Improvements
- Implement a more sophisticated authentication system.  
- Enhance the UI with responsive design principles.  
- Expand features such as real-time train tracking and user reviews.
